                        <h4>what is jwt</h4>
                 <p>  Jwt , or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. <br/>
                   Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. <br/>
                   JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
